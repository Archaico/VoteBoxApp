VoteBoxApp License Exceptions

This document defines specific exceptions to the standard licenses applied to VoteBoxApp. These exceptions ensure a balance between open-source principles and sustainable growth.

1. Voting Data & Analytics
The raw on-chain voting data is publicly accessible under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0).
However, VoteBoxApp reserves the right to offer premium analytics services based on this data.
Third-party developers may access and analyze vote data only for non-commercial purposes unless given explicit permission.
2. DAO-Specific Tools & Premium Features
Certain advanced governance features, custom DAO integrations, or analytics dashboards may be offered under a separate Business Source License (BSL).
These premium tools will become fully open-source after a defined period (e.g., 3 years).
3. Forking & Modifications
Anyone can fork and modify VoteBoxApp under the terms of the MIT or Apache 2.0 License (for the core app).
However, forks that monetize or rebrand the app must clearly indicate they are independent from VoteBoxApp and must not use official branding, logos, or domain names without permission.
Smart contracts are licensed under GNU AGPL to prevent closed-source forks.
4. Contributions & DAO Member Benefits
Contributions made to the project are automatically licensed under the same open-source terms.
DAO members may receive early access to certain features or governance tools before full open-source release.
